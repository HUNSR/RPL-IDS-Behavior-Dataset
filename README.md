## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### **1️⃣ Install Contiki-NG**
Ensure you have **Contiki-NG** installed on your machine. If not, follow the official guide:  
🔗 [Contiki-NG Installation Guide](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng)

### **2️⃣ Replace Contiki-NG Files**
To apply the necessary modifications for attack simulation:
1. **Copy the entire `contiki-ng/` folder** from this repository.
2. **Paste it into your existing Contiki-NG installation**, replacing all files:
   ```
   cp -r contiki-ng/* ~/contiki-ng/
   ```
   _(Replace `~/contiki-ng/` with your actual Contiki-NG installation path.)_

### **3️⃣ Open Cooja Simulator**
After replacing the files, launch Cooja:
```
cd ~/contiki-ng/tools/cooja
./gradlew run
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Simulation to test evry thing is correct 

1. Inside Cooja, open the provided .csc simulation files from:
2. contiki-ng\IDS-example\Visualization\dataset
3. Click Start to run the network simulation.
4. The modified nodes will generate log files containing network behavior.
5. If everything is correct, close Cooja and proceed to the next step.
6. Navigate to the directory where sequential_executor.py is located:
```
cd contiki-ng\IDS-example\Visualization\dataset
```
7. To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
    python3 sequential_executor.py
```
sequential_executor.py will automatically run all .csc Cooja simulation files in the current directory using no-GUI mode.
This process will generate the required log files for further analysis.


## 📊 Dataset Generation & IDS Testing

Once simulation logs are collected, use Python scripts for dataset processing and IDS evaluation.

### **1️⃣ Process Simulation Logs**
Convert logs into a structured dataset:
```
cd contiki-ng/LSM-example/Visualization/dataset$ 
python3 sequential_executor.py
```

### **2️⃣ Run IDS Evaluation**
Test the **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using machine learning models:
```
cd ../ids-evaluation
python ids.py
```

### **3️⃣ Analyze Feature Importance**
To understand which features contribute most to attack detection:
```
cd ../feature-selection
python feature_importance.py
```

## 📄 Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
- **Node-specific features** (e.g., RPL rank, version number, packet counts).
- **Neighbor-aggregated features** (e.g., average forwarded packets).
- **Derived features** (e.g., rank difference, control-to-data packet ratio).

For full details, refer to the dataset documentation in `python-analysis/dataset/README.md`.
